      <description>Have you heard about bash (Unix shell)? but not sure what does bash actually do? Let&amp;rsquo;s see how it can save your time.. a lot.
Think of bash as a little program or function(s), to do whatever tasks you normally do in your terminal/command line faster, just by calling the function&amp;rsquo;s name. As always, don&amp;rsquo;t repeat yourself. You have to write your code and call it later by the name of the function/variable.</description>

      <description>If I can&amp;rsquo;t automate a repetitive task, i always try to find a way to make it faster. One of the pain point in creating new post with hugo is we always have to type.
hugo new posts/your-new-post.md The dynamic part is only the title itself. So the idea is, i want to run a single word function + title. And i don&amp;rsquo;t like to type minus sign &amp;ldquo;-&amp;rdquo; between words.</description>

      <description>I still remember when one of my friend said to me &amp;ldquo;I don&amp;rsquo;t use mouse, I&amp;rsquo;m a keyboard freak&amp;rdquo;. I didn&amp;rsquo;t really get the point back then, why would someone use mouse -less? isn&amp;rsquo;t mouse there to help us work faster? In some cases, the answer is yes, but while I spend so much time work on mac laptop/computer, i already find myself keep looking for shortcut for certain task, since moving my hand from keyboard to mouse &amp;ldquo;takes time&amp;rdquo; and feels like I&amp;rsquo;m breaking the &amp;ldquo;zone&amp;rdquo;.</description>
