      <description>If you got error - src refspec does not match any, failed to push some refs to&amp;hellip;- when trying to push change to remote git branch, here is how I solve it
The problem is we haven&amp;rsquo;t connect our git branch to the remote one. It&amp;rsquo;s actually just like when we first initialize our git on main.
What we need to do is using the -u or --set-upstream parameter while push the changes.</description>

      <description>If you want to test remote branch locally, you can use fetch method on git to try it on your machine
 First, we need to fetch the remote branch  git fetch origin remote-branch-name remote-branch-name is your branch name on remote Git
What is fetch in Git? Fetch is a command in Git to download commit, files and other info from a remote repository.
Checkout new branch Now, we can checkout a new branch by pointing to the fetched branch above  git checkout -b local-branch origin/remote-branch-name Your local-branch can be any name you want the branch name on your machine.</description>

      <description>We&amp;rsquo;ve learnt how to Checkout Remote Pull Request On Github And Run Locally
But those steps are pretty long to start reviewing changes in our text editor. So I made a bash function for me to save some time:
function checkPR() {git fetch origin pull/&amp;#34;$1&amp;#34;/head:&amp;#34;$2&amp;#34; &amp;amp;&amp;amp; git checkout &amp;#34;$2&amp;#34;} usage
checkPR PRNUMBER BRANCH-NAME This way I just need to above function, and directly on the new branch where PR happened.</description>
