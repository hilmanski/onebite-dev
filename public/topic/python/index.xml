      <description>Normally we can just update our poetry version like this
poetry self update But not if you have poetry &amp;lt; 1.1 version
If you look at the poetry documentation there&amp;rsquo;s this warning
 Poetry 1.1 series releases are not able to update in-place to 1.2 or newer series releases. To migrate to newer releases, uninstall using your original install method, and then reinstall using the methods above.
 How to uninstall Uninstall the poetry version first.</description>

      <description>Here is how I solve my poetry python configuration problem, where Additional properties are not allowed (group was unexpected) issue
Background problem New poetry (I believe from version 1.2) introduce a &amp;ldquo;group&amp;rdquo; dependecy
Which causing this error if you have version &amp;lt; 1.2
You can spot this in your pyproject.toml, if you have something like [tool.poetry..group..]
Solution Upgrade your poetry to recent version or at least 1.2 (better communicate with your team).</description>

First we need to import uuid with uuid.UUID(string) will convert &amp;ldquo;anythathasdash&amp;rdquo; to &amp;ldquo;any-that-has-dash&amp;rdquo;
return str(uuid.UUID(string_id)) But let&amp;rsquo;s assume our string is not clean. It has several possibilites, like having string before or having question mark that normally shows up on a link, ect.</description>

      <description>If you&amp;rsquo;re using bcrypt package in python, and try to use checkpw but keep failing, probably you save the hashed password in database wrong. Here&amp;rsquo;s how I solve it.
On storing the hashed password to database
password = password_from_user.encode(&amp;#34;utf-8&amp;#34;) hash = bcrypt.hashpw(password, bcrypt.gensalt()) stored_password = hash.decode(&amp;#34;utf-8&amp;#34;) #The key is to decode it first # continue by saving it to DB And how you compare it alter, using checkpw is like this:</description>

      <description>Just like git, When you have multiple branches on your migrations of sqlalchemy&amp;rsquo;s alembic. It will tell you that you have two different versions that need to be solved. Normally, it happens when you and your teammate working together and each add migrations. So you need to merge it.
If you check you heads, with
alembic history It&amp;rsquo;ll show you that it got&amp;rsquo;s more than one head.

What caused this error You might delete your revision file on alembic folder manually. While in your database, the version pointed to that version. So it can&amp;rsquo;t find the file. That&amp;rsquo;s why this error shows up.</description>
