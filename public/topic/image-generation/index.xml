      <description>I was stunned, the first time I saw Dall-E 2. I really want to use it. While waiting for the beta invitation. I got my hand on other image generation, such as: StableDiffusion (via dream studio) and Midjourney.
This is not a comparing blog post between the three. It&amp;rsquo;s just my raw result from my experience.
Midjourney  Easy UI. Very fun to play in discord. The image is not as accurate as I want though  StableDiffusion (via Dream Studio)  Image is very far from what I want Found a local-installation (no credit applied?</description>
