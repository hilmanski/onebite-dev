      <description>We&amp;rsquo;ve learnt how to Checkout Remote Pull Request On Github And Run Locally
But those steps are pretty long to start reviewing changes in our text editor. So I made a bash function for me to save some time:
function checkPR() {git fetch origin pull/&amp;#34;$1&amp;#34;/head:&amp;#34;$2&amp;#34; &amp;amp;&amp;amp; git checkout &amp;#34;$2&amp;#34;} usage
checkPR PRNUMBER BRANCH-NAME This way I just need to above function, and directly on the new branch where PR happened.</description>

      <description>How many times a day did you do this on command line?
git add . git commit -m &amp;#34;commit msg&amp;#34; git push origin branchName It&amp;rsquo;s my ritual every time I want to push change on remote git repository.

      <description>Have you heard about bash (Unix shell)? but not sure what does bash actually do? Let&amp;rsquo;s see how it can save your time.. a lot.
Think of bash as a little program or function(s), to do whatever tasks you normally do in your terminal/command line faster, just by calling the function&amp;rsquo;s name. As always, don&amp;rsquo;t repeat yourself. You have to write your code and call it later by the name of the function/variable.</description>

      <title>Create New Hugo Post Faster With Bash</title>

      <description>If I can&amp;rsquo;t automate a repetitive task, i always try to find a way to make it faster. One of the pain point in creating new post with hugo is we always have to type.
hugo new posts/your-new-post.md The dynamic part is only the title itself. So the idea is, i want to run a single word function + title. And i don&amp;rsquo;t like to type minus sign &amp;ldquo;-&amp;rdquo; between words.</description>
