When choosing developer tools, it's important to consider your needs and objectives. There are many different types of developer tools available, so it's important to do your research before making a decision. 

## TLDR; key point

1. There is no one "best" developer tool - it depends on your needs and preferences.
2. Consider both open source and commercial options when looking for the right tools for you.
3. Don't be afraid to experiment with different tools until you find the ones that work best for you.
4. Make sure the tool has all the features you need and that it fits your budget.
5. Check reviews and ratings from other developers to get an idea of what they think of the tool.
6.  it is important to consider how active the community is. This will help you if you ever have any trouble.

## At the early stage of development, what's important is building things.

When you're just starting out as a developer, it's important to focus on building things and not on which tools are the best. There are a lot of different developer tools out there, and it can be overwhelming trying to choose the right ones. The most important thing is to pick the tools that will help you get your job done efficiently and effectively. Remember that you can always change your toolset as your needs evolve

## Ask other people

Make sure to do your research and ask around for advice from experienced developers before making any decisions. That way, you can get a sense of what people who are already in the field think about the various options out there. It can also help you find tools that you may not have heard of before.

## Paid tool is also an option

When choosing the best developer tools for your needs, it is important to focus on what you want to achieve. There is no single "best" developer tool - it depends on your needs and preferences. Consider both open source and commercial options when looking for the right tools for you. **Paid tool is also an option.**
Don't be afraid to experiment with different tools until you find the ones that work best for you. It will save you time and money in the long run. 

## Pick a tool you're comfortable with 

When choosing a developer tool, it's important to pick one that you're comfortable with. It will make the building process much easier. But it doesn't mean  you shouldn't look out for other good alternative. Keep a balance.

## Look for strong (active) community

The community behind the tool is also important – look for a strong community of developers who can help you troubleshoot and answer questions. It  also ensure to keep the tool up-to-date and improved over time.

## Others

Consider the features and capabilities of each tool, and how they align with your needs. 

**Make sure the tool has all the features you need** – there's no point in using a tool that doesn't have everything you need. Check reviews and ratings to get an idea of what other developers think of the tool. Consider your budget when choosing a developer tool – some tools are more expensive than others, so make sure you choose one that fits your budget.

Be sure to stay up-to-date on new developments in the world of developer tools, so you can make the best decision for your project.
