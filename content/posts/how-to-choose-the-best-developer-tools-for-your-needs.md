When choosing developer tools, it's important to consider your needs and objectives. There are many different types of developer tools available, so it's important to do your research before making a decision. Consider the features and capabilities of each tool, and how they align with your needs. Pay attention to reviews and ratings from other developers when choosing a tool. Be sure to stay up-to-date on new developments in the world of developer tools, so you can make the best decision for your project.

## TLDR; key point

1. There is no one "best" developer tool - it depends on your needs and preferences.
2. Consider both open source and commercial options when looking for the right tools for you.
3. Don't be afraid to experiment with different tools until you find the ones that work best for you.
4. Make sure the tool has all the features you need and that it fits your budget.
5. Check reviews and ratings from other developers to get an idea of what they think of the tool.
6.  it is important to consider how active the community is. This will help you if you ever have any trouble.
## At the early stage of development, what's important is building things.

When you're just starting out as a developer, it's important to focus on building things and not on which tools are the best. There are a lot of different developer tools out there, and it can be overwhelming trying to choose the right ones. The most important thing is to pick the tools that will help you get your job done efficiently and effectively. Make sure to do your research and ask around for advice from experienced developers before making any decisions. Remember that you can always change your toolset as your needs evolve - what matters most is that you're able to build the things you need to succeed.

## Focus on what you want to build rather than the tool you're using.

When choosing the best developer tools for your needs, it is important to focus on what you want to achieve. There is no single "best" developer tool - it depends on your needs and preferences. Consider both open source and commercial options when looking for the right tools for you. **Paid tool is also an option.**
Don't be afraid to experiment with different tools until you find the ones that work best for you.

## Pick a tool you're comfortable with and that has a strong community behind it.

When choosing a developer tool, it's important to pick one that you're comfortable with. The community behind the tool is also important – look for a strong community of developers who can help you troubleshoot and answer questions. Make sure the tool has all the features you need – there's no point in using a tool that doesn't have everything you need. Check reviews and ratings to get an idea of what other developers think of the tool. Consider your budget when choosing a developer tool – some tools are more expensive than others, so make sure you choose one that fits your budget.
