We need an image for each of our blog post to make it stand out on social media. But generating for each one for our post is not fun. That's why you'll love [Imagin](https://imagin.live/about)! I write regularly on my blog, I know it's not fun to have to prepare Social/OpenGraph Image for each one of the post. We just want to write! 

This is a dynamic image generator, where the image will change according to your title. You just have to put our API link once. *Imagin* that!


I create this project as part of Auth0 and Hashnode hackathon #Auth0  #Auth0Hackathon. It's an Idea I have a long time ago, but definitely need a push. Thanks for Hashnode to create this hackathon event, which force me to do it.
