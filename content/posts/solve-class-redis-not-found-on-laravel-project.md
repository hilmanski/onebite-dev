Do you encounter error Class Redis not found on Laravel project and looking for a solution how to resolve this bug? 

You might instal phpredis already, but you forgot to install redis itself.
- Make sure to install redis
- Make sure to run redis with 'redis-cli' command

Refrence:
[Install Redis based on your OS](https://redis.io/docs/getting-started/installation/)
