I often found myself selecting multiple variable on VSCode, but the problem is, it is case insensitive. Today I learn how to make it case sensitive.

When selecting with cmmd/ctrl + D, in right corner on that file, you'll see the toolbar shows up. See the "Aa, ab, .*" toolbar.

If you click on the 'Aa' button , then it'll only select the exact case sensitive for you

## Shortcut to make selection case sensitive
To be able to use this feature without moving cursor/mouse, we can use shortcut to make selection case sensitive -> cmmd + opt + c

Happy code!
