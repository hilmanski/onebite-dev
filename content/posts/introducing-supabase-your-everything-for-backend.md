The number of things we have to be grateful for is far more than our ability to do it. One more thing to be grateful for as a developer is [Supabase](https://supabase.io/), it's an open source firebase alternative. We can create a backend for our project really fast. Including a Postgres Database, Authentication system, instant APIs for all, realtime subscriptions and Storage, all presented with a beautiful dashboard.

## Supabase's features

These are some features that available for use for free, while they're in beta.

**Database**
Every project in Supabase is a full Postgres database. For someone who prefers SQL than noSQL, it's an easy win. It also supports "Row Level Security"

Almost every project need an authentication system. Supabase provides it for use. Add user sign ups and login, via magic link, OTP, email/password and even social login.

No need to register on other services for storage. It's available for storage, organize and serve large files .Any media: ex" videos and images.

**API**
All services mentioned above comes with API that automatically generated for us. 

**Dashboard**
I fall in love with Supabase's dashboard on a first sight. Beautifully crafted. You can see usage's statistic, database, authentication data, storage, API documentation and running SQL query there
