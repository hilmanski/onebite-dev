I always see posts about Rust on dev-related blogs. I don't have the motivation to learn about it, as I heard it's built for people who wants super fast application, which I don't need right now. 

Maybe I can use this blog to motivate me. 

As long as we have the time, why not learn something new.  
It might helps in the future. So.. let's go to the [Rust website](https://www.rust-lang.org/)

## Why learn Rust lang?
The word "performance" and "reliable" always shows up on a Rust post. You can also see on their landing page, it says:

"Rust is blazingly fast and memory-efficient: with no runtime or garbage collector, it can power performance-critical services, run on embedded devices, and easily integrate with other languages."

and

"Rust’s rich type system and ownership model guarantee memory-safety and thread-safety — enabling you to eliminate many classes of bugs at compile-time."

It also run everywhere! in Command line, as server language, in low-resource devices and can easily be converted to WebAssembly.

## Learning resources
Rust team wrote a book: [The Rust Programming Language](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/)
[Rust youtube channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCaYhcUwRBNscFNUKTjgPFiA)
[Rust by example](https://doc.rust-lang.org/stable/rust-by-example/)
[Exercises to get used to reading and writing Rust code](https://github.com/rust-lang/rustlings/)

## My plan to learn Rust
I will write my journey as a series on this blog. Every little thing I learn, will be written down here. It motivates me to keep learning about Rust (at least getting started).

I'll read throught the [book](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book) and write the simple version here (not too detail).

## Context
I already have programming experience before. I'll assume if you want to follow this series, you also already did.

So this is not for someone who is new to programming language.

Let's roll!
