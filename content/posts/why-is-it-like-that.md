During debugging my app, I jump between solutions until I found what I want. But I forget to ask what causing the behavior in the first place.

Let's say I try solution A, it didn't work. Change the code , try solution B. Didn't work either? change the code again to solution C. Until I found the final results I intended.

Often times it bring me to the same bug again and again.

I need to change how I debug my app. So now, when I try solution A, I'll dig deep and ask why it doesn't work. Just like when I first encounter the error. That way, I may find the correct solution faster by just improving the current fix I try, instead keep jumping between solutions from scracth.
