Hi, hello world!

My name is Hilman, I come from Indonesia! I always want to write a blog in English, but there’s always fear and shame that haunt me. I’m not a native English speaker, so you’ll see (hope not that much) some grammar mistake at first. I’ll keep practice and make it better.





## Little bit about me

I’ve been a web developer since 2015, and realize how use useful and fun -coding- is. That's why I share a lot about programming in Bahasa (Indonesian Language) since then. I won't stop there, now is the time to share what I know to the world!

## Little bit about this

This is my newest blog, I've been blogging from different domain before. I have a new concept idea that will make myself easier to create contents and to help you reader, consume it nicely. (Try the "read in bitesize" button above. That's what's different in this blog.

## Ciao!

The only reason something keep exists is because there’s always someone, somewhere, share it to the next person.

Hope this site will be useful!
