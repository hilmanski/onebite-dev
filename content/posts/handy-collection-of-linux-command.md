I want to save all linux command that I often needed here.







## Directory and Files stuff

List all files with it's sizes
`du -sh */`

Count how many files in a dir
`ls -1 | wc -l`

## Server stuff

Change root password
`sudo passwd root`

Deleting specific key (hostname/IP address) at known_hosts
`ssh-keygen -R IP-OR-HOSTNAME`
