It's just happened to me yesterday, where I push something to main branch, but not the main branch that I want. I start panicking and looking for help how to undo my last commit before anyone see the changes

git push -f origin HEAD^:main
```

change "main" with any branch you want.

The result is flawless. People can't see the accident that just happened on you repository ðŸ˜…
