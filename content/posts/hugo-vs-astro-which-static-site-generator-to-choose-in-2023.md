Which static site generator to choose in year 2023? should you pick the newcomer Astro or Hugo that been here for a while.

> TLDR;
> I have built many sites with Hugo, but I still struggle with the overall developer experience. Currently, I am trying to migrate a site from Hugo to Astro and I absolutely love the overall experience. So for now, I definitely choose Astro as my main SSG.
> Astro uses JSX syntax, so if you come from a background in React or a similar front-end framework, it will feel like home

If you're not familiar with [benefits of static site generator](https://gohugo.io/about/benefits/), feel free to read it first. In general, static site generator are most suitable for content-heavy website, like blogs posts, marketing pages, etc.

## Principle

First, let's see what each of their selling point.

Hugo: "The worldâ€™s fastest framework for building websites"   
Astro: "Build faster websites.".

Both have word "fast" in it. What is the different?  

Hugo **focus** on making the building process VERY FAST.   
Astro **focus** on making the website VERY FAST.   

Or at least, that's what we can get from their landing page. On reality of course, both framework are:
- very fast on building/generating site 
- produce very fast website

You may only notice the different, once you're building A LOT OF PAGES. 

From experience, I can immediately see the improvement on [lighthouse score ](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/lighthouse/overview/) when building site with Astro.
