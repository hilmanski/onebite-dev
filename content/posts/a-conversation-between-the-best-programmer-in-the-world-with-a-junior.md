This is a deep question and answer from the best programmer in the world with a junior coder.

## Q: What makes you the best programmer in the world?
A: I don't know â€“ maybe it's because I love what I do and I'm really good at it. Or maybe it's because I'm always learning and keeping up with the latest trends and technologies. Whatever the reason, I'm grateful to be considered the best programmer in the world.

Not every new tool or framework is going to be a game-changer, so it's important to be thoughtful about which ones you adopt. At the end of the day, the best way to be a great programmer is to have a strong foundation in the basics, and to always be learning.

## Q: What's the best method to learn programming for you?
A: The best method of learning programming for me is a combination of self-study and practice. I'm constantly reading books and tutorials to learn new things, and then I practice what I've learned by building projects. I also find it helpful to participate in online forums and communities, as it allows me to interact with other programmers and get feedback on my work.

## Q: Do you write open source software? why?
A: Yes, I do write open source software. I believe that open source is a great way to learn and improve your skills as a programmer. It allows you to see how other developers solve problems, and also gives you the opportunity to contribute back to the community. Additionally, writing open source software can be a great way to build your portfolio and showcase your skills to potential employers.

## Q: How do you choose where to work, since you already have money and fame.
A: I choose to work with companies and on projects that are interesting to me and that I believe will be impactful. I also look for opportunities to work with talented people and to learn new things. Ultimately, I want to work on projects that I'm passionate about and that I believe will make a difference in the world.

## Q: As the best programmer, how do you debug your code efficiently?
A: I debug my code using a combination of print statements and debugging tools. I also make sure to test my code thoroughly before I release it, so that I can catch any bugs that might exist. Additionally, I always try to think about how my code might break in different scenarios, and I test for those cases as well.

## Q: As the best programmer, how do you write your code? 
A: I write my code in a clear and concise manner. I also make sure to comment my code so that others can understand it. Additionally, I always strive to write code that is maintainable and easy to read.

## Q: How to write a maintainable code? 
A: In order to write maintainable code, you should first comment your code so that others can understand it. Additionally, you should try to write code that is easy to read and that follows best practices. Additionally, it is helpful to use version control tools so that you can track changes to your code over time.

## Q: What would be your top 3 advice for people who wants to go to the next level as a programmer?
A: My top three pieces of advice for people who want to become better programmers are as follows:

1. Never stop learning. Technology is always changing, so it's important to stay up-to-date on the latest trends and technologies.
2. Be willing to experiment. The best way to learn is by doing.
3. Write code that is maintainable and easy to read.

## Q: Do you sometimes feel burned out with all of this tech things?
